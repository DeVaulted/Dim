Dim
===

Dim is a jailbreak tweak that lets you dim your iPhone or iPad screen below the minimum brightness by adding a black screen overlay with variable opacity. When enabled (through a Flipswitch toggle), the overlay opacity can be changed by using the volume up and down buttons after they are configured in Activator's settings.
